# DrCT 1
We propose a model called DrCT from the paper Attention-based Full Slice Brain CT Image Diagnosis with Explanations.

The csv files are the prediction of DrCT and RSNA-1 model, and the sequence-level true label.

The link of the first place solution to this Challenge is: https://github.com/SeuTao/RSNA2019_Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection

This is the architecture of our model: ![image](https://github.com/GuanghuiFU/DrCT_1/blob/master/architecture.png)
